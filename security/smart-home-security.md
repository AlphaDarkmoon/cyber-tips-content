# Smart Home Security

Secure your IoT devices and smart home network.

## Smart Home Risks

- Unauthorized access to cameras
- Voice assistant eavesdropping
- Botnet recruitment
- Privacy invasion
- Network vulnerabilities

## Securing Your Network

### Router Configuration
1. Change default admin password
2. Enable WPA3 encryption
3. Update firmware regularly
4. Disable WPS
5. Use guest network for IoT
6. Enable firewall

### Network Segmentation
- Main network: Computers, phones
- Guest network: Visitors
- IoT network: Smart devices
- Work network: Separate VLAN

## Device-Specific Security

### Smart Cameras
- Change default passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Regular firmware updates
- Disable remote access if unused
- Check privacy zones
- Review who has access

### Voice Assistants
- Mute when not in use
- Review voice recordings
- Delete history regularly
- Disable purchase options
- Turn off when discussing sensitive topics

### Smart Locks
- Use strong unique codes
- Change codes regularly
- Monitor access logs
- Keep batteries fresh
- Have manual backup key

### Smart TVs
- Disable cameras/mics
- Review privacy settings
- Update firmware
- Limit app permissions
- Use external streaming devices

## Privacy Best Practices

1. **Review Permissions**
   - Camera access
   - Microphone access
   - Location services
   - Contact access

2. **Data Sharing**
   - Read privacy policies
   - Opt out of data sharing
   - Disable analytics
   - Review third-party access

3. **Regular Audits**
   - Monthly device review
   - Update firmware
   - Check connected devices
   - Review access logs

## Manufacturer Trustworthiness

**Considerations:**
- Company privacy policy
- Data storage location
- Update frequency
- Security track record
- Transparency reports

**Trusted Brands:**
Generally considered more secure:
- Apple HomeKit devices
- Google Nest (with caveats)
- Amazon devices (privacy concerns)
- Philips Hue
- August locks

## Setup Checklist

When adding new device:
- ☐ Change default password
- ☐ Enable 2FA if available
- ☐ Update to latest firmware
- ☐ Connect to IoT network
- ☐ Disable unnecessary features
- ☐ Review privacy settings
- ☐ Test functionality
- ☐ Document credentials

## Common Vulnerabilities

1. **Default Credentials** - Change immediately
2. **Outdated Firmware** - Auto-update on
3. **Unencrypted Communication** - Check specs
4. **Open Ports** - Minimize exposure
5. **Weak Wi-Fi** - Use WPA3

## Decommissioning Devices

Before disposing:
1. Factory reset
2. Remove from app
3. Revoke access permissions
4. Delete account data
5. Wipe storage if possible

## Monitoring Tools

**Network Scanners:**
- Fing (mobile app)
- Advanced IP Scanner
- Angry IP Scanner
- Router admin interface

**Check For:**
- Unknown devices
- Unusual traffic
- Outdated firmware
- Open ports

## Emergency Response

If compromised:
1. Disconnect device from network
2. Change all passwords
3. Update firmware
4. Factory reset if necessary
5. Check bank/credit cards
6. Monitor for identity theft

Remember: Convenience vs security - find your balance!
