# Two-Factor Authentication Guide

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring two forms of verification.

## What is 2FA?

2FA is a security process that requires two different authentication factors:
1. Something you know (password)
2. Something you have (phone, security key)

## Benefits

## How to Enable 2FA

2. Select "Enable Two-Factor Authentication"
3. Choose your method (SMS, app, security key)
4. Follow the setup instructions
5. Save backup codes

## Best Practices
